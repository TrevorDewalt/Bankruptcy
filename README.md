# Bankruptcy
Ever wonder if you could predict if a company would go bankrupt?

Using data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009 we are going to try to do just that. This will be a classification task predicting a binary result, bankrupt or not bankrupt. Accuracy, precision, recall, receiver operation characteristic curve (ROC) and ROC-AUC (area under the curve) will be the classification metrics that we use to evaluate the efficacy of our models.
Our aim in this project is to build, train and test some predictive models to correctly identify bankruptcy.
